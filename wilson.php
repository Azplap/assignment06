			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<div class="sect">
				<img src="images/w1.jpg" alt="Young Wilson">
				 <p>Wilson was born in New Jersey to Henry and Sophie (nee Krugman) Wilson. Wilson's father is Protestant and his mother is Jewish. Due to the mixed religions the family never seriously practiced one religion or another, although Wilson is recognized as being Jewish. From the time Wilson was born until he was ten his father Henry was a woodshop teacher that did oddjobs for extra money, Sophie was a nurse. </p>
				 <p>Shortly after Wilson's tenth birthday the family moved to Pennsylvania where Henry Wilson started up a construction company along with his brother, this money made the family comfortable financially. Wilson did well in school and was also talented athletically, he was the captain of his high school's varsity tennis team and also played the sport in college. He also plays squash.</p>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<div class="sect">
				<img src="images/columbia.jpg" alt="Columbia">
				<p>Wilson has ties to both McGill University (he is often seen wearing a sweatshirt from the university) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University (he has a Surgical Degree from it in his office). It is reasonable to presume he went to McGill as an undergraduate and Columbia for medical school. He also has a degree from the University of Pennsylvania where he did his specialty training in Oncology.</p>
				<p>During his later part of medical school, he met and married his first wife, Sam Carr. It appears Sam was about a year ahead of him and that they married in medical school. The marriage was strained as Sam took an unpaid internship after medical school, leaving James to work two jobs to pay the bills as well as continuing to attend to his final year of medical school.</p>

			<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
			<div class="sect">
				<img src="images/w2.jpg" alt="House and Wilson">
				<p>The two friends are so close that gay references have been made to the relationship between the two characters of the show. During season 2 in "The Mistake" House has made a joke about the relationship between them. Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as "touching and genuine." Hugh Laurie said that the relationship between the characters is "not just buddydom."</p>
				<p>Wilson and House do share similar tastes. They are both big fans of monster trucks. They are often attracted to the same women (even Cuddy at one point). However, at the heart of their relationship, Wilson often acts as House’s conscience, and House acts as an honest critic of Wilson’s own personality, pointing out faults such as his infidelities and his need to please everyone.</p>
