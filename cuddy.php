			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<div class="sect">
				<img src="images/c1.jpg" alt="Young Cuddy">
				 <p>Cuddy was born in 1968. Her mother, Arlene Cuddy, is still living, but her father is deceased. Her father was Jewish from birth, but her mother was a Catholic who converted to Judaism when Arlene married Cuddy's father. She has one sister, Julia Cuddy. She also comes from a long line of physicians - her great grandfather published a key medical text. </p>
				 <p>We also know that she has also wanted to be a doctor ever since she was 12 years old. She was the editor of her high school yearbook. She often felt her mother treated her more harshly than her younger sister, but later came to believe that her mother only pushed her knowing that she was capable of great things. The only other salient fact about her early life is that she admitted to Wilson (who later told House) that she once slept with her fatherâ€™s best friend.</p>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<div class="sect">

				<p>Lisa Cuddy went to the University of Michigan where she was in the pre-med program and, in addition, audited classes in their medical school. During this time, she met Gregory House, who was working at the university bookstore during the time he was appealing his expulsion from Johns Hopkins Medical School.</p>
				<p>It has never been revealed where Cuddy went to medical school, but we do know that she finished second in her graduating class at the age of 26 and made Alpha Omega Alpha, an honor society for medical students. Remarkably, she was disappointed with the result.</p>

			<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
			<div class="sect">
				<img src="images/c2.jpg" alt="Cuddy and House">
				<p>Cuddy first knew of House when she was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan while he was at medical school. She describes him as "already a legend" at the time. Cuddy decided to hire House despite the fact that she acknowledged that he had already been fired from four other hospitals. The exact reason why she decided to hire House has always been kept ambiguous.</p>
				<p>House constantly bombards Cuddy with sexually suggestive comments, often remarking about the display of her breasts or the size of her buttocks. She has always seemed to enjoy this and even encouraged it during the poker game in All In. Once House started taking an interest in Cuddy's relationships, Cuddy began to believe that House was actually attracted to her. However, her reaction appeared to be that House had an earlier opportunity to have a relationship with Cuddy and did not do so.</p>
